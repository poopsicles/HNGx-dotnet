# [HNG Internship X](https://www.zuri.team/programs/hng/x/home) (with .NET/C#)

I'm on the backend track, because backends are cool, and this is in C# because it's an okay language (and I promised myself I'd do something serious with .NET for a change)

perhaps I'll make a secret Rust version[^1] and see how far I can go...
