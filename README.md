# [HNG Internship X](https://www.zuri.team/programs/hng/x/home) (with .NET/C#)

I'm on the backend track, because backends are cool, and this is in C# because it's an okay language (and I promised myself I'd do something serious with .NET for a change)

perhaps I'll make a secret Rust version and see how far I can go...

## Stages cleared:

- 1 - [`stage-one`](stage-one/README.md)

This is a monorepo, check out the actual folders if you want to see any code

## Tech used (so far):

- .NET 7 (and C#...whatever version they're on now)
- Docker (on a Windows machine, no less!)
- ASP.NET 

## Todo:

- [X] Finish readme
- [ ] Add some razzle dazzle ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©
